## Implementation Strategy

1. **Setup Improvements**
   - [ ] Create test utilities for common operations
   - [ ] Set up test database configuration
   - [ ] Create mock factories for test data
   - [ ] Improve test isolation

2. **Testing Approach**
   - Use integration tests for routes
   - Use unit tests for utilities and helpers
   - Use mock data for external services
   - Focus on error cases and edge conditions

3. **Mocking Strategy**
   - [ ] Create mock implementations for:
     - Database operations
     - External APIs (Cloudinary, OAuth providers)
     - Email/SMS services
     - Payment gateways

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - [ ] Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline
   - [ ] Set up coverage thresholds
   - [ ] Add test status badges to README

## Long-term Goals

1. Achieve and maintain:
   - 80% overall coverage
   - 80% branch coverage
   - 80% function coverage
   - 80% line coverage

2. Implement:
   - End-to-end tests for critical flows
   - Performance tests for key endpoints
   - Security tests for authentication/authorization
   - Load tests for high-traffic endpoints

## Notes

- Focus on business-critical paths first
- Prioritize security-related functionality
- Document test patterns and best practices
- Regular review and updates of test coverage
- Consider adding property-based testing for complex logic
